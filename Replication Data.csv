The income checks do nothing but confuse parents, counselors, and students. Do they have OKpromise or not. Some students struggle in high school and college when it comes to math and/or reading, they should not be penalized for their struggles. The $5000 increase did hurt many low income families that have excellent students that have very little means to send their child or children to college. Adding a cap to the number of credit hours that can be earned needs to be looked at more closely.  If those credit hours are needed to successfully complete the student's major or minor emphasis areas, those credits need to be paid for by OKpromise.

1,1,4,5,25,10,10,2,4,1,3,4,4,5,Undocumented does not mean their parents are not paying taxes. Most of our undocumented students have really hard working parents who have found a way to support their kids in a country that allows their children to be safe where the country of birth did not. Some of these parents were swindled by people through thinking the social security number they received for work was from a legal means or process. Their purchased number allows tax money to go into our government system but does not allow tax returns to come out... These kids are caught in the middle of a political cross-fire. It angers me that this change was made.  The increase in income limits is a great asset to students and should be raised to keep up with costs of living allowances.,"5,6",,,,0,,4,1,0,,3,,0,0,3,,,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,"1,2,3,4,7",,"Classroom presentations where the students discover what is on the page via a scavenger hunt type team project.

We realized as seniors that nothing was originally filed... WHAT A MESS...,Those with parents who do not speak English or have never considered college for themselves or their kids need their hands held through the process.

Maybe someone in juvenile services could cross check the OK Promise database and take the burden off the school counselors.,1,1,1,,3,7,5,2,,1,,131,,153,1762,.39897844,.086833142,.21763869,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,3,6,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,,0,11,1,400363000000,BARTLESVILLE,4003630,Washington County,BARTLESVILLE,74003,1-Regular school,2-No,,32-Town: Distant,6-Not eligible for either TAS or SWP,36.733265,-95.973206,3-High,1762,703,1762,1092,103,173,29,230,3,132,96.779999,.058456298,.098183885,.61975026,0,0,1,0,.38024974,74141294592,2,0,0,0,1,2,,0,0,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8.6833143,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,3,Bartlesville,2015,40,OK,12780,"Bartlesville, Ok ",in Micropolitan Area,40_12780,12780,"Bartlesville, Ok",in Micropolitan Area,40_12780,12780,"Bartlesville, Ok",in Micropolitan Area,40_12780,428,40147,,0,1,0,424.83334,273.30325,23.093098,58.829597,.13543257,.028413786,.13847689,.054358017,.64331871,.44561896,.55438101,.050090626,.12110727,345.2176060676575,72.4267413765192,352.9775891304016,138.5585827827454,1639.819469451904,1135.882729530334,1413.117285609245,200.3947895765305,2348.605194091797,2549,4332,10,0,735,304,156.0099945068359,385.7900085449219,105.9899978637695,1,6,15.036376,14.540977,14.803357,14.971252,-.49539852,-.23301888,1.0340692,1.015741,.43174917,.52816612,.46579939,.096416958,.03405023,.64939439,.052103344,.13701388,.61536789,.072153941,.13778222,.63696927,.0535651,.1486782,.0535555,.015475168,.090482779,,,,0,0,0,0,2110.6179,1311.4708,.50304204,.078379087,.58142108,.39318365,.07901971,.47220334,.49473658,.079453729,.57419032,.38407633,.077809624,.46188596,.10985838,.10921775,.11066025,.11230437,-1,12,.078617021,.92138296,.43062827,.32295701,.17354369,.12052117,.21335505,.25244299,.85371703,.035523403,.17647059,.044276457,.083333336,.21568628,.52941179,.15686275,.84166664,.014040561,.34482759,.15327565,.64406782,.69444442,.52777779,.55555558,.779661,.041112456,.17896865,.31664348,.16856781,.25721455,.1706399,.2710163,.85638297,.032658529,.17896865,.86486489,.8018018,.32432431,.19166666,.875,0,0,.025,0,60801.832,8.6759691,2.2315347,3.8878932,19999,15.779193,3.5501409,4.4446669,49686.563,8.259696,2.5101602,3.2905054,62931.621,9.3847103,2.3290868,4.0293522,.40381387,.40349895,.45032272,.37782758,.33539426,.84345651,.92576432,.14152937,.33837461,.27527848,.30443966,.10734308,.1422468,.12557431,.15086769,.15435553,.15256688,.095119305,.038703047,.067634463,.052494578,.1483046,.099171259,.025271149,.089736268,.056677233,.12678958,.19591278,.16046499,.1883948,.31384861,.24951333,.16746204,.0060509192,.088825852,.84548891,.72770232,.78385615,.040255591,.044973917,.042498995,.049650893,26746.896,23302.334,32018.148,.34258008,.12850057,3945,3985,.19828925,.29742718,-3.3220999,.22663194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),400363029826,4.00363e+11,matched (3),59,14,matched (3),0,matched (3),.050847456,BARTLESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL,24,35,0,3,35,8,1,0,18,14,22,3,1,13,2,0,16,13,0,21,5,0,5,0,9,14,16,5,35,.47499999,40147,2-No,703,103,1092,3,132,1762,173,29,230,96.77999877929688,18.20999908447266,,0,BARTLESVILLE,74003,matched (3),0,1,matched (3),0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),1,0,0,3.2679739,3.2679739,0,.13725491,.03267974,.03267974,.86274511,.54285717,.60000002,40,0,.52499998,.125,.125,.47499999,0,670,16,0,4,1,0,1,1
1,5,4,4,100,100,10,1,5,3,1,5,5,5,"I've been an educator for 50 years and here are my opinions:  Remedial work should be done in high school.  If a student takes the taxpayers' money, he/she should pass the coursework in order to continue--that's just common sense.  I don't believe the income checks while in college are justified--however, I don't know the legislature's rationale for doing so.  Once a kid is in college, don't put more roadblocks in their way.   Income cap should be at least $60,000 to capture more low income families.  I think Oklahoma citizens should receive the benefit of the tax dollars that go to OK Promise, although I know of undocumented students whose parents work and pay taxes to the US and to Oklahoma.  I see those 1040's when I enroll students in our college prep program. I think the current cap of 5 years or first bachelor's degree is fair. I'm not familiar with a limit of credit hours, but a student should not be able to change majors and use more OK Promise money than   a student who focuses on getting on with college.","1,2,6",,2,2,0,,0,1,0,,2,,0,3,0,,,"1,3,4,5,6,7",I cannot officially do these things.  I work  with the students so they can be sure of meeting requirements.,"2,3,4,8",Saturday seminars and small group meetings at schools.,"We use a powerpoint presentation during recruitment meetings and parent meetings where we compare the cost of college and common awards students can receive to pay for college.  The information comes from the current Counselors' Resource Book published by OSRHE. At each Saturday seminar, we include a 15 minute OK Promise student review of their individual transcripts and figuring their OK Promise GPA. We send letters to our sophomores' families who have not completed the enrollment.  We call and text parents.  I have made home visits just for that purpose.   ","We talk, talk, talk to them individually and in groups.  We teach them to analyze their transcripts and figure GPAs for college track courses.  They read the list of required courses from the flyer and compare their transcripts to that list each time a new transcript comes out.  School counselors are very helpful in sending us copies of the students' transcripts at the end of each semester, so we can work with students in a meaningful way.

With the parents, I sit down wherever I can meet them and go over the paper application one item at a time.  I show them their child's transcript and GPA so they can see proof of eligibility. Parents and students who have computer access still have to submit paper documents, so I offer them access to a copier and provide the OK Promise envelope and stamp to mail in the documents. I urge them to keep a copy of their submitted docs for further reference if needed.

We put a monetary value on it based on commonly attended colleges in our area.  We do this at parent meetings when students enroll in our college prep program.  We also call or meet with parents who have not enrolled their student in OK Promise.  ,1,"When a parent refuses to release financial information, I tell the student he/she must concentrate on applying for other scholarships that do not require the information. This has happened to me 4 times.    .  ",Students who do not have access to computers or the internet at home are more likely to need help. ,1,Our IHE partner is OSUIT.  We use their facilities for Saturday seminars and 5 week summer college sessions. We pay a small rental amount for use of meeting rooms on Saturdays.

1,1,4,5,100,75,10,1,2,5,2,2,5,5,I don't think undocumented students should receive money for college when we have residents in the state that do not receive money and their parents pay taxes.  I think if a student can take more hours with a double major they should be able to do so.  A student shouldn't be penalized because a parents income raised.  Many students are actually on their own after they leave for college the first time and their parents do not assist them.    Sometimes students are not fully prepared for a class due to it not being their best subject area or they had a less than qualified teacher in high school.  Or they have test anxiety and don't score well on placement tests.

1,1,3,,100,10,10,,3,2,4,2,4,5,"I would still like to see the income limit raised a little more.  I have students who missed qualifying by less than $500 at my previous school.  I have only been in this school for 1 year as Guidance Counselor, and was out of counseling for the previous 3 years.  The changes that were made in 2017 were ones I had to check on to be sure I was up to date when I came in before school started. There have only been a few students who signed up in the past, and unfortunately I had several Seniors this year who didn't realize their deadline had passed.   The SAP policy is a good one for the most part. It prevents students from going to college just for the ""fun"" of it and emphasizes the importance of getting their education. I am a little mixed on the remedial course policy.  Sometimes their are students who are conscientious students, but may be weak in an area.  They will be successful, but it takes some extra help to get there. On the cap, my only concern is if a student switches majors and they are able to finish in the 5 years, but the cap prevents them from receiving the scholarship for their last few hours. I have not been able to find out what the cap is (I haven't call the OK Promise Office), just that it will be determined by the Regents this year. It may be set high enough that it isn't an issue. I can see why it should be in effect after a Bachelor's Degree.","1,2,6,7",Mailings from OK Promise,2,2,0,,0,1,1,No Other ,2,,0,2,0,,,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,"1,3,4",,One-on-one and Parent Meetings,"I am checking the credits  on a regular basis to be sure they are taking they are taking the correct courses, and trying to watch their GPA's to be sure they aren't dropping too low.",4,"At this school, it is being sure they are informed, which apparently they have not been for the last several years.",0,0,0,5,,"I have tried to focus on getting information out to the students in parent meetings, in one-on-ones with students and/or parents, and  my sophomore mailing that I do in the spring of each year.","1,3,6",,4,4,3,2,1,1,,,1,I go over the requirements and explain what documentation they need.,1,"I have had situations in the past where the student had a parent who was incarcerated, another student who had a parent pass away, and other students where a parent had lost a job.  I have always been able to call the OK Promise office for help in these situations and they have been FANTASTIC. They have guided me in what information was needed and how to go about it.  I couldn't ask for any better.  I actually had to make a phone call yesterday on an unusual situation and was given exact details on how to handle it.  They are AWESOME!","In small schools, alot of the time it is the parents who approach me with questions regarding the application.",3,,"I wish we could raise the income limit a little more.  There are many families that still struggle to put their child(ren) through college.  I had a single mom who missed the limit by less than $200 one time and that was due to child support that wasn't always regular. She was able to put her children through college, but it involved selling her house and moving into a tiny one in a different neighborhood so she could afford it.

Across the state many of us express the same frustrations. There are many families who are claiming less because of farm deductions( multi million dollar land owners living in large new homes and new cars) and they qualify for OK Promise. Many, many of these..NOT RIGHT! Also those who have had tickets like DUI's or alcohol related tickets that eventually get worked off because of probation and community service but still get to keep OK  Promise. NOT RIGHT!  Have had some that have had trouble in high school and in college and get to continue on like nothing ever happened. We have many families that don't meet the income requirement so I feel the undocumented students need to work with the federal government to be cleared first. I think that OK Promise should NOT pay for the remedial courses, students have to have some buy in to be accountable just as there should be a credit limit taken.

Students need to have something invested in their education and a reason to work towards not taking remedial classes.

1,1,3,3,50,30,7,3,2,5,4,4,5,5,"1) Some students don't have the academics to get through colleges without remedial courses. Lack of funding because they have to take remedial courses shouldn't deter them from going to college. 2)$5,000 in the big picture isn't much but it could make a huge difference in a students life. 3)I somewhat agree because a student could easily take to many classes just because they have the funding.  That could waste funding for another student, especially if it is not needed for their degree. 4)I don't support or oppose this one because that could mean a student didn't qualify one year but the next they could but on the other hand a student could qualify one year and not the next.  As a farmers daughter we could be really rich one year and really poor the next...not everyone's income is steady. 5)I believe that if a student is undocumented they should not get the same financial benefits as a document student. 6)I think OK Promise should be treated like a scholarship, if they can not maintain a good gpa then they may not deserve the scholarship.  I would suggest to not make the gpa requirement very high.Lower income students don't always have good support at home and going to college could be a huge adjustment which could cause dropped grades.","1,2,6",,"2,3,4",2,0,,0,1,0,,2,,0,3,0,,,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,"1,3,4,5,6",,"In class sessions with students, freshman camp and parent information nights.","I make their schedules, intervene during discipline issues",3,,0,0,2,0,,Walk parents directly through the process.,"1,2,3,6",,4,3,3,3,1,1,,,1,"Walking them through the process, parent info night",1,"No, I do not.","Yes, students with parents that are not highly involved or the student does not live with the parents.",1,They help me get information out to our community.,,1,1,1,,1,7,4,2,,3,,164,,37,396,.32323232,.093434341,.2890625,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,6,,,,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,1,,3,,2,3,4,2,0,0,0,1,0,12,1,3,4,5,6,,,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6,,,,,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,,0,141,0,402380000000,PERKINS-TRYON,4023800,Payne County,PERKINS,74059,1-Regular school,2-No,,42-Rural: Distant,6-Not eligible for either TAS or SWP,35.985512,-97.018005,3-High,396,128,396,291,18,9,0,78,0,0,25.35,.045454547,.022727273,.7348485,0,0,1,0,.2651515,275027394560,1,0,0,1,1,3,,0,1,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,9.3434343,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,4,Perkins-Tryon,2015,40,OK,44660,"Stillwater, Ok ",in Micropolitan Area,40_44660,44660,"Stillwater, Ok",in Micropolitan Area,40_44660,44660,"Stillwater, Ok",in Micropolitan Area,40_44660,407,40119,,0,0,1,117,91.276581,4.1864862,3.1815314,.15639485,.00048895046,.027192578,.035781935,.78014171,.35511485,.64488512,0,.15480079,109.7891883850098,.3432432413101196,19.08918905258179,25.11891889572144,547.6594619750977,249.2906303405762,452.7093811035156,70.80080604553223,631.1991958618164,702,704,4,0,237,0,39.36999893188477,97.12999725341797,20,0,1.5,14.845498,14.829445,14.791299,14.835764,-.0160532,-.054199219,1.0010825,1.0036643,.35468113,.35468113,.35468113,0,0,.77910596,.036049437,.02758133,.77910596,.036049437,.02758133,.77910596,.036049437,.02758133,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,2110.6179,1311.4708,.35468113,.099596642,.45427781,.35468113,.099596642,.45427781,.35468113,.099596642,.45427781,.35468113,.099596642,.45427781,0,0,0,0,-1,12,.10085585,.89914417,.30102041,.22618453,.07772021,.1,.24285714,.22142857,.82901555,.027986007,.16,.07692308,.5714286,.66666669,.66666669,.66666669,1,0,.33333334,.2972973,0,0,.66666669,.33333334,.81818181,0,.17333333,.25287357,.088235296,.20467836,.15204678,.28070176,.80882353,.016718913,.17333333,1,1,.85714287,0,.78571427,.21428572,0,0,0,46999.594,5.6632576,2.4601142,2.3020303,63749.75,2.3095188,1.1411676,2.0238209,28749.25,2.2815325,2.0435009,1.1164823,46499.699,6.4880486,2.627686,2.4691112,.34874269,.35985959,.13930468,.15873235,-.52524954,.88369811,,,.22473946,.23759462,.23140676,.10614525,.12723657,.11610135,.11258604,.17924528,.14070494,.032448377,.011455526,.023592951,.077187806,.15431267,.10972143,.0034414947,.057951484,.026435474,.09439528,.23247978,.15264355,.11996067,.30256066,.19698693,.35840708,.01212938,.21233656,.84060311,.66210043,.74869382,.0128123,.034810126,.022654867,.030674847,24878.678,21468.391,26995.309,.2804006,-.07724604,850,855,.42982334,.39222115,1.0794137,-2.8045087,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),402380001260,4.02380e+11,matched (3),20,6,matched (3),0,matched (3),.15000001,PERKINS-TRYON HIGH SCHOOL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,0,,40119,2-No,128,18,291,0,0,396,9,0,78,25.35000038146973,15.61999988555908,,0,PERKINS,74059,matched (3),1,1,matched (3),1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,matched (3),1,0,0,,,0,,,,,1,,,,,,,,0,105,16,0,4,1,0,1,1

BY not paying for remedial classes it leaves students, who are already at a disadvantage, with yet another obstacle (finances) to overcome. It is a small steps that sets them up for failure rather than success later down the line.   The additional income checks just creates more paperwork for everyone involved. As a counselor the biggest obstacle I face is making sure parents follow up with sending paperwork in. I am at a small rural school and able to help students and parents with this. Unfortunately for some students the best thing that can happen is for them to need nothing further from their parents once moving on to attend college.

In my time spent as a counselor and time spent as a teacher, I have seen too many students who belong to middle class parents that miss out on this wonderful opportunity--including children of teachers.  On the other hand, I have seen students whose parents could pay that can write off so much on their taxes that they get the scholarship.

If they are not serious about their education then they may be going to college for the wrong reasons.  I think there are some people that would be perpetual students if there was not a reasonable cap on hours. I feel strongly that our government programs should be for our citizens, if they are working towards citizenship that would be a consideration.  The college should find out if there are extenuating circumstances that caused the student not to meet SAP.  If a parent's income level has changed dramatically then I can see where the fund could be discontinued.  I'm not sure I agree with $100,000 but maybe increase that to $150,000.

You have to have examples of college costs with OK Promise and without, I usually give examples of the cost with OU, OSU and UCO.  The majority of out parents do not have a college education if they can't see the saving they don't recognize the importance.  I try to also reach those students who do not think they are going to college right after high school and explain to them they have 3 years to start and they may change their mind within that time period.",We stress this at the beginning of the year with the kids that we know are on the program and then again at enrollment.,"1,2",,4,4,0,0,,"  Some of our students and parents will come to my office and we will apply together.  That seems to erase the stigma of the program.  I will actually have them bring their tax information with them and I will mail the application for them.

The increased income requirement makes college available to more students.","1,2,6",,4,4,0,,0,1,0,,"1,2,3",,3,3,3,,,"1,2,3,4,5,7",I try to call any parents whose student does not have an application on file w/OK Promise before the June deadline of their sophomore year.,"1,3,5,8",I try to call any parents whose student does not have an application on file w/OK Promise before the June deadline of their sophomore year.,I have found the phone calls or asking parents when I see them if they have sent the OK Promise application in.,"At the end of each year and the beginning of each, I try to do a curriculum check.",3,,0,0,1,0,,"The main ""barrier"" for some of our students is providing divorce decrees or paper evidence that a parent is NOT in any way financial assisting the family in every day living.",6,,4,4,4,3,2,2,1,,0,,1,I cannot think of any at this time.,This does not seem to be an issue.,2,,"I would like to see children of certain professional groups--military, education, law enforcement--automatically eligible for the program.",1,1,1,,3,7,6,2,,2,,170,,23,161,.4037267,.14285715,.35384616,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,6,,,,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,1,3,3,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,9,1,3,5,8,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,213,0,403330000000,WYNNEWOOD,4033300,Garvin County,WYNNEWOOD,73098,1-Regular school,2-No,,42-Rural: Distant,1-Eligible for Title I TAS provides no program,34.644119,-97.162621,3-High,161,65,161,107,16,5,1,30,0,2,14.67,.099378884,.031055901,.66459626,0,0,1,1,.33540374,388391862272,1,1,1,1,3,3,,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,14.285715,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,Wynnewood,2015,40,OK,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,269,40049,,0,0,1,50.5,31.468058,3.3763142,4.3381743,.21925355,.0048544239,.085904442,.06685771,.62312984,.49362823,.50637174,.011461318,.20487106,66.43382549285889,1.470890492200851,26.02904534339905,20.25788533687592,188.808349609375,149.5693531036377,153.430643081665,43.14932155609131,259.8506813049316,303,537,3,0,143,8,13.5,49.09999847412109,22.70999908447266,0,.5,14.658948,15.625299,15.033525,14.633035,.96635151,.37457752,.9381547,.97508383,.48587197,.48587197,.48587197,0,0,.62209445,.064026065,.084240124,.62209445,.064026065,.084240124,.62209445,.064026065,.084240124,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,2110.6179,1311.4708,.48587197,.14301062,.62888259,.48587197,.14301062,.62888259,.48587197,.14301062,.62888259,.48587197,.14301062,.62888259,0,0,0,0,-1,12,.142407,.857593,.29166666,.13845165,0,0,.18181819,.15909091,.97058821,.040567953,0,0,.66666669,0,.66666669,.66666669,.33333334,0,.40000001,.11805555,.84210527,.5,.25,.625,.94736844,.044776119,.059060402,.14319809,.082644626,.22314049,.05785124,.20661157,.93043476,.02903739,.059060402,1,1,1,0,.66666669,.33333334,0,0,0,50642.793,3.1617575,1.7636784,1.7927064,21999.6,4.7502666,3.2386613,1.4667377,7499.25,47.004234,9.4008465,5,56307.063,3.008338,1.687163,1.7830749,.31071162,.28432459,.29428527,.5376448,-.30008709,,1.8614101,,.10685714,.14551084,.12716919,.099542335,.13216025,.11600227,.1389313,.20380434,.16859983,.0045801527,.0063405796,.0053852526,.011450382,.096014492,.050124276,.0053435112,.13677536,.065451533,.10152671,.1594203,.12800331,.11984733,.26449275,.18599835,.24351145,.017210145,.14001657,.83881313,.70876086,.77326971,.051625241,.02256532,.038665254,.0990991,29488.686,25774.182,31563.564,.40258554,-.21669821,605,605,.41309279,.77671117,-3.5060444,-2.535893,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),403330001834,4.03330e+11,matched (3),12,2,matched (3),0,matched (3),.25,WYNNEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL,8,9,0,1,9,3,0,0,8,2,8,2,0,2,0,0,7,2,1,4,0,1,2,0,2,0,6,3,9,.60000002,40049,1-Yes,65,16,107,0,2,161,5,1,30,14.67000007629395,10.97000026702881,,1,WYNNEWOOD,73098,matched (3),0,1,matched (3),0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,matched (3),1,4.347826,0,8.695652,0,.043478262,.17391305,.086956523,0,.82608694,.66666669,.44444445,10,.1,.40000001,.2,0,.60000002,0,54,13,0,3.25,0,0,1,1

Knowing that they are doing income checks when the student is in college is simply wrong!! I hate that I in essence been lying to these hard-working parents and students. We are penalizing parents who are bettering themselves, finding better careers and increasing their annual incomes.   At one time there was a piece of legislation that came across that got many of us in education very hopeful. I can't remember the author of the bill, but I don't think it even went to the other chamber floor for a vote. The bill would allow certified teachers' children (I think those who had taught 5+ years) to be eligible for Oklahoma's promise regardless of their annual income. Those of us who are married are not eligible for this awesome program.

1,1,3,5,20,20,9,1,1,5,1,2,5,5,"Since many of our students will be first generation college students and 70% of our school receives free/reduced lunch our students need more academic support. Unfortunately much of the counselors' time is spent on daily duties (2 hours EVERY DAY), testing during peak seasons, we cannot possibly help all of our kids in a timely manner. Not paying for remedial classes when they meet the high school academic requirements doesn't help our children succeed at college. They need the help that first semester or two. Remember, many have never seen a college campus! If you want to help produce successful educated students help them by allowing remedial courses to be paid for.

1,1,3,2,,,9,3,3,1,5,3,5,5,I do not support OK Promise for non residents. The students receiving this support should come from legal and tax paying families.

This is sometimes all a parent needs. ,"1,2,3",,4,3,4,4,3,3,,,1,"I just had a parent in last week filling out the application. It was very positive.The parent was appreciative. I don't think first time parents understand how fast the 8-10th grade window approaches. Parents will delay in filling out the info so I have always offered to assist them. In this way I know it has been completed. Since I am at the middle school and I was formerly the only counselor in the district, I would follow up on all my students. I believe that the high school at Jenks tracks the OK promise students.  ",1,I had a student who's parent would not supply her taxes.

I feel that their OHLAP should cover their remedial classes. I think raising the income limit is okay because the average income has gone up some since it was last updated. I think that undocumented students should have a chance to get OHLAP if they have proof of being in the process to get citizenship. ,"1,6",,2,,0,,0,4,0,,2,,0,2,0,,,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,"1,4,8",Formal letters to parents.,Sending home formal letters with information in english/spanish.,"Make sure that they are enrolled in the proper classes, and making good grades.",3,,0,0,3,0,,"I make a call to OK Promise and find out what the student is lacking, and then have a meeting with the student and parent to go over missing information.

Usually you have one parent that won't give the other parent what they need so I am the middle man and call the uncooperative parent and get the information for the student.,1,"Yes, I called the parent who wouldn't provide information and explained how much this would benefit their child and they wound up giving me the information we needed to get the student enrolled.",The students who's parents don't speak English or don't have the parent support at home.,2,,My only recommendation is that there be a better way to help students with divorced parents. Sometimes you have a parent who hasn't been at all active in a child's life and they still require information for that parent. When they haven't support the child at all I don't think it's fair to the student to have to count their income towards their OK Promise. I'm talking about a parent who doesn't pay child support or help out in any way. ,1,1,1,,2,7,6,2,,2,,151,,12,83,.56626505,.14457831,.25531915,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,,2,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,6,1,4,8,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,6,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,20,1,400486000000,BOISE CITY,4004860,Cimarron County,BOISE CITY,73933,1-Regular school,2-No,,43-Rural: Remote,4-Eligible for Title I SWP provides no program,36.72818,-102.50493,3-High,83,47,83,42,1,40,0,0,0,0,7.7800002,.012048192,.48192772,.50602412,0,0,1,1,.49397588,87648452608,1,0,0,0,1,2,,0,1,,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,14.45783,0,,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,3,Boise City,2015,40,OK,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,444,40025,,0,0,1,18.333334,9.166667,.16666667,9,0,0,.4909091,.0090909088,.5,.59454542,.40545455,.033783782,.19256757,0,0,54,1,55,65.39999961853027,44.60000038146973,23.00000023841858,86.99999904632568,110,212,3,0,57,10,9.890000343322754,22.63999938964844,10.64999961853027,0,0,14.233851,13.953488,14.192738,14.21112,-.28036308,-.041113853,1.0200927,1.0028968,.59449112,.59523809,.59449112,0,0,.50705564,.0075757578,.48536861,.40909091,.045454547,.54545456,.50705564,.0075757578,.48536861,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,2110.6179,1311.4708,.59449112,.2124183,.80690944,.59449112,.2124183,.80690944,.59449112,.2124183,.80690944,.59449112,.2124183,.80690944,0,0,0,0,-1,12,.20909092,.79090911,,.19846492,,,,,,.030973451,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,.20110957,,,,,,.013869626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.3489031,,,.16412213,.16903915,.16666667,.19193155,.24211854,.21663563,.21290323,.098101266,.16645327,.017204301,0,.010243278,.021505376,.2056962,.096030727,0,.056962024,.023047375,.13118279,.26898733,.18693982,.10752688,.28164557,.17797695,.31612903,.015822785,.19462228,.8197183,.69672132,.75728154,0,.043290045,.019157087,0,20410.551,13957.75,26287.621,.51031405,-.24980417,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),400486000167,4.00486e+11,matched (3),8,,master only (1),0,matched (3),.375,BOISE CITY HIGH SCHOOL,2,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,40025,1-Yes,47,1,42,0,0,83,40,0,0,7.78000020980835,10.67000007629395,,1,BOISE CITY,73933,matched (3),0,1,matched (3),1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),1,0,0,0,0,0,.16666667,0,0,.83333331,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,41,12,0,3,0,0,0,1

1,1,4,3,100,30,9,2,4,5,5,3,5,5,"I agree with the income raise to $55,000 because that still catches the struggling middle class who need help to send their child to college. I agree that we should not be paying tuition for a student who is not maintaining satisfactory academic standing.  The student should place value on this scholarship and do the best they possibly can academically.  If they are not trying their hardest they do no deserve to receive the scholarship for that semester. I mainly agree that OK Promise should not cover remedial classes.  There's just a little part of me that is aware OK students have to be remediated too much so this will affect a lot of students who struggle financially anyway--making it harder to pay their college bill.  Overall though, I feel OK Promise probably shouldn't be paying for remedial classes (what we need to look at is why so many of our students need remediated--that's a whole other subject). Undocumented students should not be allowed to apply for OK Promise.  We can't provide support to those who aren't citizens.  We need to take care of our own first. I totally agree with the continuing income checks.  If a parent ends up making more than $100,000, they shouldn't expect OK Promise to pay for their child's tuition.  At that point, the parent should be solely responsible.

I tell them of my own personal experience with OK Promise and how I have had three children graduate from college using OK Promise, as well as having a senior who will enter college in the Fall (who is qualified for OK Promise).  Additionally I have an upcoming sophomore who is qualified for OK Promise.  I think my own personal story is persuasive in helping parents realize I have experience with the program and I'll bend over backwards to help them with the application process.  I tell parents to come to my office with their tax return and I will help them fill out the application.  I have had several parents take advantage of this.","1,2,6",,4,4,4,2,2,2,,,1,Info. given at parent meeting.  Regular correspondence mailed to parents regarding the OK Promise program. ,1,Many times.  Some parents are just unmotivated to complete the application.  I think a lot of times this is because the parent has a low expectation for their child (basically the parent has an ignorant attitude).  The parent doesn't have experience with higher education so they lack insight. Some of the difficulties applying have to do with divorce situations and families having to produce divorce decrees.  Or families having to produce child support papers or verification of social security benefits.  People can get overwhelmed thinking they have to contact the court house for a divorce decree or the social security office for income documentation.  ,Students in guardianship's or adoptions usually have questions.  Very academically smart students often ask for help because they have the insight to know that they want to go to college and need the financial help.  Student's who are not sure they want to go to college are the ones I have to really push to fill out the application.  Teenagers typically live for today so it's not easy to make them think about the future.  Filling out paperwork now for something in the future isn't exactly something they consider important.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,139,,12,92,,,,,,,,,,,,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,,3,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,1,2,3,4,5,,,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,6,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,162,1,402733000000,SENTINEL,4027330,Washita County,SENTINEL,73664,1-Regular school,2-No,,42-Rural: Distant,6-Not eligible for either TAS or SWP,35.155781,-99.170158,3-High,92,62,92,69,0,20,0,3,0,0,9.5,0,.2173913,.75,0,0,,0,.25,314592788480,,0,0,1,1,3,,0,1,,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,,,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,1,3,Sentinel,2015,40,OK,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,,,Not in Metro/Micro Area,,397,40149,,0,0,1,23.833334,16.894772,.13986929,6.1424837,.024598932,.0029343208,.25772661,.0058686417,.70887148,.45977011,.54022992,.072674416,.18604651,3.51764714717865,.4196078702807426,36.85490369796753,.8392157405614853,101.3686237335205,65.74712610244751,77.25287818908691,18.62835240364075,124.3716449737549,143,261,2,0,64,25,16.73999977111816,27.73999977111816,3.799999952316284,0,.5,13.927428,13.927428,13.927428,13.927428,0,0,1,1,.45977011,.45977008,.45977011,0,0,.70646715,.0052287583,.26019955,.71372545,.0078431377,.25098041,.70646715,.0052287583,.26019955,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,2110.6179,1311.4708,.45977011,.1302682,.5900383,.45977011,.1302682,.5900383,.45977011,.1302682,.5900383,.45977011,.1302682,.5900383,0,0,0,0,-1,12,.1302682,.86973178,.31578946,.12457627,.37931034,.09375,.1875,.15625,.98275864,.010416667,0,.029702971,.44444445,.26666668,.26666668,.26666668,.66666669,.048543688,,,,,,,,,.1,.14435947,.20588236,.14705883,.11764706,.20588236,.89999998,.0076481835,.1,1,1,.42857143,0,.77777779,0,0,0,0,54399.559,4.8719788,1.7463229,2.7898498,,,,,34374.125,,,1.5714155,55599.438,4.9563088,1.6936485,2.9264095,.28363022,.27706742,,.10810984,,1.2917087,,1.2809129,.10028654,.1607717,.12878788,.17395626,.24548353,.20852594,.23747681,.056782335,.17056075,.0074211503,0,.004672897,.025974026,.17981073,.082943924,0,.097791798,.036214951,.025974026,.25236592,.10981309,.18181819,.35331231,.2453271,.35621521,.012618297,.22897196,.77240145,.51434427,.65200764,.018561484,0,.01174743,0,29680.881,18749.5,34795.555,.66247851,-.25321382,170,170,.38829821,.0036404685,,-1.4035118,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),402733001444,4.02733e+11,matched (3),,,master only (1),0,matched (3),,BLANCHE THOMAS SENIOR HIGH SCH,1,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,3,.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SENTINEL,73664,matched (3),1,1,matched (3),1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,matched (3),,0,1,0,8.333333,0,.16666667,0,.083333336,.83333331,.66666669,.66666669,4,0,.5,0,.25,.5,,23,19,0,4.75,1,1,1,1

1,1,4,3,95,25,9,2,2,4,4,1,4,5,"I oppose the cap on credit hours because if a student is showing satisfactory progress and making the grade, I encourage them to take advantage of the program as much as possible - perhaps earning a double major or a major and a minor.  That is why I support limits to funding for students who do not show satisfactory progress.  Provided, of course, that they have a probationary period first.    I understand the reasoning behind limiting remedial courses, but sometimes students need those courses, and it's not always their fault.  Sometimes students simply are not great testers or need more time and support to master a skill or concept.  I do support raising the income limit for the program enrollment; in fact, I think that the limit should be even higher, as the cost to attend a regional university is so high.  It is honestly too costly for most middle-class families; I feel I'm qualified to speak on this, since I am a middle-class parent with a student who will be a senior next year.  I will probably accumulate more debt sending my kids to college than I did with my mortgage.  That is ridiculous!    I know some immigrant students, and, while I support them furthering their education, I do not particularly like the idea of funding it with my tax money.    I do support the income checks while students are in college.  I do not think families whose income is typically $100,000 a year or more annually should qualify.

I am very supportive of providing help and opening doors for access to college with financial aid, however, I feel students should have some responsibility to meet guidelines and criteria that nurture responsibility and self efficacy.

1,1,4,3,90,30,9,2,5,2,5,4,5,5,"I think it is unfortunate that students who have been in our school system for the majority of their schooling are not able to access many avenues of assistance with college funding just because they were born outside the US.  I understand this is a very broad spectrum, but we are hurting ourselves to some degree when these students cannot afford higher ed and are well suited for it.  I 100% agree that remedial classes should be at the expense of the student to, as much as possible, encourage students to put forth their best effort to avoid them.

1,5,4,5,80,100,7,1,1,1,1,4,4,5,"I support the income increase because it allows more families/students to become eligible to receive the aid. I do not support non-payment for remedial courses because our schools do not have the resources to properly educate students.  That is why they are taking remedial courses in the first place.  If these students can't take a basic course due to monetary restrictions, then you basically have just prevented them from pursuing a degree in higher education.  I support an overall cap on credit hours, but not a semester cap.  I think students need to be aware of the time spent in college.  The national average is going on 6 years to graduate.  The more time in college, the more money spent.  A cap might help get them graduate in a decent amount of time.  I do not support annual income checks.  A one-time before you start is acceptable, but additional checks causes more issues for students and it should not be their fault that their parent's incomes increased.  That should be a benefit. I do not support no eligibility for undocumented students.  There are many who would like to go to college that can't because of no aid.  They already can't receive federal aid so any scholarship would help.  I do support academic progress.  It just makes sense.  If you don't make sufficient academic progress then why continue monetary support.","1,2,3,4,6,7",TRIO state meetings,2,3,1,3,0,"1,2",1,TRIO,"1,2,3",,3,3,3,,,"4,5,6",,"1,2,3,4",,one on one sessions,My academic counselor will monitor their progress each year and will do a final check around December of their senior year.,"1,3,4",Procrastination,2,0,4,5,Procrastination,"learning barriers and compliance barriers- this is where those one on one sessions become extremely effective.

Most students are not looking that far ahead and by the time they realize they want to attend college it is too late to apply for this program.,0,3,4,5,Time limit (8th thru 10th grade),I try to provide the information to them as much as possible and make sure they are in teh required classes.,"1,3,9",time limit of application (8th - 10th grade),4,3,3,3,2,3,,,1,Providing the necessary information at Parent Nights.,1,"I helped them scan the necessary documentation, met with their parents one on one and stressed the importance of completing the application.  I have even printed off my own daughter's college tuition to show them how much Oklahoma's Promise helped her.",Lower income students and students whose parents have language barriers.,2,,"As I have stated previously I believe the children of our underpaid state workers should be given Oklahoma's Promise to assist financially with further educating them beyond high school. I also believe the timeframe needs to be extended.  There are so many families whose circumstances shange dramatically from the time they are in junior high to their senior year (divorce, parental death, job loss, etc...) and I know of so many students who decide late in their high school career to attend college and are unable to apply for Oklahoma's Promise.",1,1,1,,1,7,4,2,,2,,163,,79,1012,.55039525,.078063242,.14183123,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,2,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,6,8,,,,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,3,9,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,0,87,1,401356000000,GUTHRIE,4013560,Logan County,GUTHRIE,73044,1-Regular school,2-No,,31-Town: Fringe,5-Eligible for Title I SWP provides SWP program,35.89341,-97.421478,3-High,1012,557,1012,690,86,84,2,52,0,98,59.119999,.084980235,.083003953,.68181819,0,0,1,1,.31818181,190542741504,1,0,0,0,1,2,,0,1,,0,,,0,1,1,0,7.806324,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,1,2,Guthrie,2015,40,OK,36420,"Oklahoma City, Ok ",in Metropolitan Area,40_36420,36420,"Oklahoma City, Ok",in Metropolitan Area,40_36420,36420,"Oklahoma City, Ok",in Metropolitan Area,40_36420,28,40083,,0,1,0,249.5,182.31607,20.555496,33.642879,.048669461,.0033768453,.1348412,.082386754,.73072571,.54408371,.45591626,.034149118,.12549801,72.85818386077881,5.055137276649475,201.8572826385498,123.332971572876,1093.896423339844,814.4933624267578,682.5066604614258,165.7870101928711,1331.212997436523,1497,1779,6,0,441,120,90.56999969482422,206.1399993896484,29.23999977111816,2,2,16.288116,16.343977,16.500092,16.308641,.055860519,.2119751,.99658221,.98715311,.54429942,.54429942,.54429942,0,0,.73058605,.082465932,.13484535,.73058605,.082465932,.13484535,.73058605,.082465932,.13484535,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,2110.6179,1311.4708,.54429942,.11069414,.65499359,.54429942,.11069414,.65499359,.54429942,.11069414,.65499359,.54429942,.11069414,.65499359,0,0,0,0,-1,12,.11074617,.88925385,.28282827,.16815339,.19915254,.22424242,.30606061,.21212122,.743487,.041109156,0,.18552631,.76829267,0,.63414633,0,.84523809,.046324272,.3275862,.20839937,.45454547,.29824561,.68421054,.59649122,.45555556,.076318741,.10375671,.18340324,.22048998,.24615385,.20879121,.38021979,.73885351,.03651616,.10375671,1,1,.2820513,0,.98809522,0,0,0,0,41018.316,6.8001246,2.6059983,2.6094124,24165.832,6.5510216,4.3301911,1.5128713,23014.104,2.1760306,1.9480388,1.1170366,53043.172,7.802587,2.1551805,3.6203868,.38532022,.36529127,.39829078,.2408575,-.074956603,.53930855,.50525987,.81198561,.18055949,.16907661,.17450875,.19780625,.18326969,.19031869,.12037538,.15219493,.13573563,.051073812,.02030555,.036221061,.038801659,.10249468,.069548167,.0090236422,.068845488,.03790142,.14979246,.25913751,.20257655,.12398484,.35389674,.23497012,.28911749,.0081222197,.15347274,.81282049,.68838167,.74825233,.042808942,.058608949,.050146826,.035670355,21924.824,18228.645,27684.428,.36917993,.075654872,2245,2275,-.38026112,-.21363336,-2.3255227,-1.1596617,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,matched (3),401356000633,4.01356e+11,matched (3),48,5,matched (3),0,matched (3),.0625,GUTHRIE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL,20,33,0,0,33,7,1,0,17,8,30,7,0,9,2,0,17,10,1,27,1,1,3,0,2,4,22,7,33,.22857143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GUTHRIE,73044,matched (3),1,1,matched (3),0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,matched (3),1,1.2658228,0,3.7974684,1.2658228,.012658228,.34177214,.037974682,.012658228,.65822786,.24242425,.81818181,35,.028571429,.77142859,.085714288,.028571429,.22857143,0,322,13,0,3.25,0,0,1,1

It makes it handy that the application has the envelope attached to it, so there's no question as to where it has to be sent.  Many of our students do not have access to computers or good internet service, so the paper applications are the best resource I have to make sure I make contact with each student and parent.  I also send out a blanket letter to my 10th graders to let them know they are nearing the end of their time to sign up.  The students on the incomplete list were all mailed an envelope addressed to the Oklahoma's Promise so they could put whatever they were missing inside and get it in the mail.

1,5,2,3,10,5,8,2,2,5,2,2,5,2,"I was a school counselor for 12 years before going into administration and have seen several changes to the Oklahoma's Promise program over the years.  I support the changes to not continuing to fund a students education if they fail to make or maintain educational progress.  As a parent who has paid to send two children to college - that was our rule as well.  If I am not going to waste my money, why would I want to waste the governments money (which is technically mine.)    In regards to undocumented students not being able to receive Oklahoma's Promise, I support that change - I know some students do not get to choose how they come to this country, but it should be allowed for those that have followed the process legally.  However, I believe we should allow undocumented student the opportunity to attend higher education - if they work hard enough, they can find a way to pay for it.  I struggled with the decision to to pay for remedial courses as I have seem many students who are just not good test takers - I can give you numerous student who are 4.0 students who have had to take remedial courses based on taking a test or tests.  One specific example that comes to mind is a valedictorian several years ago who could not get above a 18 total on her ACT - but graduated from OSU with a 3.6 in Business Communication.  She had to take remedial courses based on her test results.  Test results do not define who a student is or who they will become or limit what their potential is.   I can understand capping the number of credit hours the program will pay for, but we must understand we are asking 18 year olds to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life and they may need to explore a few options before they decide.  With that being said, we told our own children, we will pay for four years and four years only - anything above that and you are on your own.   I believe we need to set a limit and stick to it and not keep moving it - families of students that qualify one year and then the bar is moved the next do not understand and it is hard to explain to them.  I do not really agree with the additional income checks during college, I am okay with the ones during high school, but ones they are accepted into the program, I think they should stay.  I think you are setting students up to not finish if we ""kick"" them out of the program midway through college and they nor their family have had time to plan accordingly.  ","1,2",,2,2,0,,0,,0,,3,,0,0,2,,,"4,6",,"1,2,3",,One-to-one conversations with students and parents,"My self, the hs principal and the hs counselor all check transcripts to ensure students are meeting the academic requirements and are on tract to graduate.  We check them each summer after grades are posted to transcripts and compare what they need to what they have pre-enrolled in for the net school year.  Our counselor meeting individually or in small groups with students at the end of the year to go over their credits and what they need to take to meet eligibility.","2,4",Lack of follow through - they just don't always follow up with getting their end of things taken care of with out almost having to hound them to get it done.

1,1,3,4,85,65,10,1,4,1,3,4,2,3,"I do not believe tax money should go to illegal immigrants for college education.  I believe we give them more than we should already.  Academic standing - I believe they should make good grades but I also believe students can have difficulty adjusting to college and might need that taken into account.  Perhaps a probationary period if their grades were not up to standard before being kicked off the program. I do not believe the jump from 50 to 55K in income is helpful to very many applicants.  I would actually like to see the jump be to 60 or 65K.  Cap in college hours - the program is not designed for allowing double majors, etc.  Helping them get one degree/first degree is enough - in my opinion.  I don't think the additional income check is worth the time it would take for personnel to chase down all the paperwork. The second check at senior year should prevent those who can manage to just appear ""low income"" for one year due to business or farm ""write-offs"" as has been done in the past.  I don't believe any remedial courses should be paid for under this program but it is not something I feel strongly about.

I think that just because a student has to take a remedial course does not mean that they are not capable of being successful in college.

Also I believe that students should have some grace period during college before they lose their funding.  Finally, I believe that once a student qualifies for services they should be covered.  Personally, my son attended because I took a different job and was able to qualify for one year.

Just because their parents' lives changed shouldn't affect the students' scholarships.  I strongly agree with students maintaining good grades while keeping this scholarship.   Good grades are required with all scholarships and why should this one be different.  I think Oklahoma Promise should pay for one or two remedial courses because it is not the students' fault sometimes in not receiving the best education, especially in math and science.   I have seen great students needing more help in math and science because of our teachers not being highly qualified in teaching that subject matter.

Adding income checks should be expected to hold accountability for money being used. I believe the income level should be raised to at least $60,000. I have many of my students in that 55-60,000 income. Students who don't maintain their grades should not be allowed to continue using this money. On the immigrant students I would like to see those who applied for Dream Act to be able to use their SS for education as well as work. I also have a student this year who is here legally-her father works for a corporation and they have brought him into management. He has a SS# but his dependents only have a TAX ID#. She will be Valedictorian of her class but she cannot receive any state or federal aid.

They laugh and tell how they quit working or took a lesser job for one year to qualify and then went back to making good money so they didn't have to help their children pay for college.  Is this fair?  If the programs runs short on funds, they should support those students whose families truly fit into the income guidelines.  I also feel that undocumented students getting their education paid for can't work in the United States legally once they complete a degree.  Why add to the cycle of teaching them to lie to stay in the United States or get a job that takes away money from a citizen who is trying to provide for their families.

We have called several times and verified the address to deliver additional paperwork to.  They keep telling me they aren't getting any paperwork to complete the process.

1,1,,3,100,80,8,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,"'-  My problem with income checks is that sometimes single parents want to remarry.  The income should not be a factor in when and if a single parent wants to get married.  Eliminating for remedial may stop some students from going to college.  They may only need one class in a remedial program but will give up their dream because they can't afford to pay for even one class.  Putting limitations on the number of years the state will pay is a better way to me.  I'm opposed to paying for someone who is not doing well in school.  Students lose scholarships for grades dropping below a certain gpa.  The same should be true for this.  I'm in favor or raising the limit because even $55,000 seems low to me if you come from a family with 2 or more children.","1,2,6",,1,1,0,,0,1,0,,"1,2,3",,3,2,2,,,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,"1,2,3",, Printed materials in Kelley Connection,Once they begin sophomore year I keep track of their progress and share that information with their academic counselor.

Eliminating award for remedial courses may hurt some students that may be at an educational disadvantage due to their income status and the lack of resources from the high school they attend.

1,1,4,2,25,30,10,1,2,1,1,2,5,2,"Students who qualify for a scholarship when they graduate should receive that scholarship regardless of whether their parents income increases - as is the case with most scholarships - because they are counting on that funding and cannot predict if their parents income will increase. Also, many students are no longer dependent upon their parents after high school and the parent income is not a reflection of their financial situation. I strongly oppose the elimination of eligibility for undocumented students if they would normally be protected under DACA since again, those students were not in control of their situation and do not have options available. The students who worked throughout school to maintain good grades and attendance should be rewarded for that effort if they meet the income qualifications. If there is a cap for the number of credit hours covered, it should at the very least cover the hours to equivalent to those need for a bachelor's degree with a minor.

I deal with these issues by calling the OK Promise office to get their advice on how best to help the parent and what is necessary to complete the process. My questions and the parents' concerns are usually answered quickly and easily. A few times, parents just weren't able to provide the appropriate documents and the student was not able to finish the application process.

This also effects the students  6years of financial aid, which will cause issues with retention. I do believe income checks should be evaluated to make sure that everyone has a fair shot at receiving aid. Dealing with underrepresented populations, you will deal with a lot of students taking remedial courses. Why no help students who's school districts are failing by giving that student the chance to take remedial courses. This will indeed help those who are disadvantaged academically and economically. I support the income increase to 55,000 because it gives more families who were on the borderline to receive aid. I strongly disagree with withholding funds from students who are not in good standings. I believe their should be academic support/tutoring service evidence shown to Oklahoma City Promise in order for students to maintain college funding. I disagree with totally giving up on students.

1,1,4,4,98,80,10,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,Just as Tulsa Achieves does not pay for remedial courses I agree that Oklahoma's Promise shouldn't either.  A student should prepare themselves academically by taking college preparatory classes in high school and not easy classes to maintain a high GPA.  In addition I support the income checks to keep students from eligibility who may have a parent that takes a different job. That takes away from a student in need.  In addition I believe the same with the undocumented students.  Let's give them a way to become citizens legally and then make Oklahoma Promise a possibility.  But first let's take care of our own US citizens and help to support them.  I want to help everyone and I hate to see anyone go uneducated; but I do believe in order to receive federal funding or state funding you should be a citizen of the United States and be paying taxes into the system to help and support these Promises.,"1,2,4,6",,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,,1,,3,0,0,,,"1,3,4,5,6",,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,Through emails about Oklahoma's Promise and also through school messenger that we utilize.

I would limit the number of zero level courses paid for and only pay for them one time not repeat classes if they fail the course, not pay again if they failed it.  I think the annual income check will be a burden on those working in the Ok Promise office and could delay payments to schools.  They need more staff to help with that if they are going to add more work to their office.  The income increase was needed.  $55, 000 seems like a lot for OK salary but not if you are paying for kids and college.

Those that do, facebook posts.    Talking to the kids about Ok Promise while taking them around a college campus tour to show them if they apply for OK Promise that college is possible.  ",I don't we go over it but the school counselor or administration usually handles that portion.  ,"1,2,3",,4,5,4,0,,"Some of the parents freak out about having to fill out the application and not know what to send in even though it says on the application.  They still contact me about what do I need to send it they are saying the application is incomplete.  Many say they don't have the time to fill it out even though it is a short application they get overwhelmed.  I have some that just feel like their child probably won't end up at college so why bother.  Which is sad because we encourage them to apply even if they aren't for sure what their future plans are because they can change.  Working with students and parents to build up a relationship.  Many times the students bring their paper applications back in to me because they can't put a stamp on it and get it mailed in, so I mail it for them.  Maybe having some postage paid envelopes.  I know online applications are becoming the trend but many of my students and parents do not have computer access or access to internet, especially in rural communities.  They are often confused when they are incomplete to why they are incomplete and we try to work with them on what they need to submit which is usually just income verification and spelled out on application but they seem to miss it or do not call Ok Promise directly ask our office instead.  Sometimes it is because they didn't go to college and don't understand the expense of college and why their student will need Ok Promise.

",1,"I have not, but there have been cases in our office where they had to contact OK Promise and spend lots of time on the phone trying to help those cases.  ",First Generation students need so much help.  Their parents don't understand the college process at all. Students that are not living with parents also need extra help.  ,1,We are a non profit so we work in various schools.  ,There are some counselors that really try to get the program information out there and students signed up.  Then I have a school that doesn't really do much about getting the information to the students/parents.  Trying to get more students from schools with low numbers of students enrolled.  There needs to be another staff added to their program to help with the income verification.  ,1,1,4,,2,7,3,1,,2,,170,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,1,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,6,7,,,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,1,,3,,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,6,1,2,3,4,8,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,216,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,0,0,1,1,3,,0,1,,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,0,4,4,5,0,0,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,master only (1),,.,master only (1),,,,,master only (1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,master only (1),0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,matched (3),-1,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,14,1,3.5,1,0,0,1
